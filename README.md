## Description

Hangman Project is a simple iOS game developed in Swift. It follows the traditional rules of the Hangman game, where the player needs to guess a word by suggesting letters one by one. The player has a limited number of attempts before the hangman is completed.

## Features

- Interactive UI: The game provides a user-friendly interface, allowing players to easily input their guesses and interact with the hangman's progress.

- Random Word Selection: The game randomly selects words from a predefined list, ensuring a unique experience with each round.

- Win and Lose Tracking: The app keeps track of the player's wins and losses, providing a challenge to improve their guessing skills.

- Play Again: After winning or losing a game, players have the option to start a new game with a different word.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/s-shaligram/Hangman


2. Open the project in Xcode.

3. Build and run the app on a simulator or a physical device.

## How to Play

1. The game starts with a random word being chosen.

2. The word is represented by a series of dashes (one for each letter) indicating its length.

3. The player needs to guess letters by tapping on the corresponding buttons on the on-screen keyboard.

4. If the guessed letter is part of the word, all occurrences of that letter will be revealed.

5. If the guessed letter is not part of the word, the hangman's body parts will start to appear on the screen one by one.

6. The game continues until the player either guesses the word correctly or the hangman is completed.

7. After the game ends (win or lose), the player can choose to play again.

## Note

- This project was developed using Swift 5 and is designed to run on iOS devices.
- The game assumes that the player interacts with the on-screen keyboard to make letter guesses.
